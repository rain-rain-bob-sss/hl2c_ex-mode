--[[Hl2c Endless Mode:
Significantly increases skills power.
In Non-Endless Mode, perks have limited functionality, Eternity perks and further do not work.
Difficulty is gained by killing NPC's. Gaining +0.05% difficulty for each XP gained from NPC.
Difficulty can be far harder than you'd expect. Limit: 1e100x difficulty.
XP gain is also reduced to 65%. (in progress)

Turns Hl2c into extremely unbalanced and one of the most unfair gamemodes of all time, what did you expect?
